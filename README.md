# Bank-Customer-retirement-predictions
Using support vector machines to predict bank customer retirement 
# Task
You work as a data scientist at a major bank in NYC and you have been tasked to develop a model that can predict whether a customer is able to retire or not based on his/her features. Features are his/her age and net 401K savings (retirement savings in the U.S.). You though that Support Vector Machines can be a great candidate to solve the problem.

# Methods

•	Get data from .csv

•	Visualization
   
   o	Visualization with seaborn ad matplotlib

•	Model training
   
   o	SVM (Support Vector Machines)
   
# Result

Using SVM (Support Vector Machines). The result is shown in the table below:

Retire: No: 0, Yes: 1
